#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This repository contains reusable Org-mode templates intended for structured
documentation of various workflows. Templates are grouped by domain under the
=templates/= directory.

See the live preview of these templates exported to HTML at
[[https://org-templates.cleberg.net][org-templates.cleberg.net]]. A set of
minimal CSS rules are applied from the =assets/styles.css= file.

To generate the HTML files locally, run the provided =export.sh= script from a
command line shell. This script processes the Org files and produces the HTML
exports. No additional configuration is required.
